Rules
-----
* A group of three or more people starts with a blank sheet of paper
* The first person writes a sentence to start the story
* The sheet is passed to the second person
* After reading the first person's sentence, the second person continues the story by writing his/her own sentence on the next line
* The first line is folded over (so it's not visible) before the sheet is passed to the third person
* The third person reads the second sentence, and writes his/her own, folding the second line over afterwards
* This pattern continues, with each person continuing the story based solely on the previous person's sentence
* At the end of the game (usually when the paper is filled or there is a general consensus), the paper is unfolded and read aloud
