      p This is a text based game-experiment-thing.
      p Rules:
        ul
          li A game starts with two or more players (preferably three or more)
          li The first player starts a story off
          li Subsequent turns involve reading the previous text and continuing the story based on it
          li Each player can only read the text submitted by the player before them, which makes for especially entertaining stories
          li The game ends when each player has gone a certain number of turns, at which point the story can be read in its entirety
